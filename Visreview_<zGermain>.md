The plot is clear, there are no ambiguities about what the elements are representing. The color choice is good, since there aren't any other colors, it is color-blind compliant as well as failing to be distracting. A histogram is an excellent choice for the categorical data. Plotting the food production logarithmically may represent the differences between the countries' production more accurately. It would allow for multiplicative differences to be more clear and would allow for differences between the first 7 countries more clearly. Also, if the food production was in hundreds of thousands or millions of tonnes, the absolute value of the food production could be seen at first glance. If a caption was added, it would be clear why this is important and what the viewer should be trying to get out of it.

the review is thoughtful and on point, good idea on the log plot though it would make the difference less obvious, so it kind of depends on which effect you want to provoke. but you were asked to include the plot in the revie markdown
